# My Forest Theme
A custom forest green theme for Obsidian v1.6.3

## About
After using Obsidian with their default and minimal theme for over 3 years, I decided to switch things up and create a custom theme that includes forest green, which is a color that has consistently helped me focus on note-taking, learning, and retention. 

## Features
- **Minimalist Design**: A clean and simple layout that reduces distractions and enhances focus
- **Custom Color**: Carefully chosen color palette of a combination of muted dark and forest greens for a soothing visual experience.
- **Enhanced Readability**: Improved typography and contrast balance to improve readability
- **Dark & Light Mode**: Seamless switching between light and dark mode of the theme based on preference.
